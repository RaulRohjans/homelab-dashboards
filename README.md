# Homelab Dashboards

This repository contains configuration files for the dashboards I use on my home server.

## Dashy

Dashy is my main landing dashboard.
The configuration file contains shortcuts to all the services running on my homelab, so they can easily be reached.

## Grafana

Currently includes two dashboards:

- **Logs Dashboard**: Custom-made to visualize logs from the applications that I host, it gets its data from lokki.
- **cAdvisor Dashboard**: Imported from the cAdvisor team, used for container resource monitoring.

This repo serves as a backup and reference for my current setup. Feel free to explore if you're setting up something similar.
